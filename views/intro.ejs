      <h1>About the Simulation</h1>
      <div class="intro-content">
        <p>
          Shigeo Kageyama, known as <strong>Mob</strong>, is an average middle school boy
          with extraordinary psychic powers. However, his emotions are deeply suppressed,
          and when they accumulate, they manifest as raw psychic energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Mob experiences various events throughout his day, his psychic energy accumulates.
          Each event can increase or decrease his energy level. When his energy reaches
          <strong>100%</strong>, he experiences an emotional explosion, releasing all his
          pent-up psychic power before resetting to 0%.
        </p>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simulate <strong>N events</strong> that affect Mob's energy level</li>
          <li>Track how many times his energy explodes (reaches 100%)</li>
          <li>Find at which event the <strong>Kth explosion</strong> occurs</li>
          <li>Customize the explosion threshold for different scenarios</li>
        </ul>
